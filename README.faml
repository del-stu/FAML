[❗] FAML - Fork Aughhhh Motherf**ker Language 😎

[!💬The world need more emojis.💬]

[❗❗] What the heck is This? 🤔

FAML is a completely unserious markup language that replaces boring Markdown syntaxs with emojis! Because who needs [😎#😎] when you can have [😎[❗]😎]? Who needs [😎**😎] when [😎[😦]😎] is so much cuter?

[😦Warning😦]: This project is 100% created for fun. Do not use in production unless you want to be hunted down by your friends 🔪

[❗❗] The Ironic Part

You know what's hilarious? The original README was written in Markdown. THE THING FAML WAS CREATED TO REPLACE! 🤦

[💬I hate Markdown so much that I created a whole new language💬]

[❗❗] Quick Start 🚀

[❗❗❗] Include FAML

I'm sorry, FAML 0.X.X can't use HTML in code block.

Or you can make a better interpreter.

[❗❗] Example Code 🎨

[😎😎]
const famlInput = document.getElementById('faml-input');
const htmlOutput = document.getElementById('html-output');
const preview = document.getElementById('preview');
        
const faml = new FAMLInterpreter();
        
const famlExample = `[😭I hate Markdown😭]`;

famlInput.value = famlExample;
        
famlInput.addEventListener('input', function() {
    const convertedText = faml.convert(this.value);
    htmlOutput.value = convertedText;
    preview.innerHTML = convertedText;
});
